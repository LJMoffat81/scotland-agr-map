"""Valuer-style residual assessment for an AGR roll (Wightman / SLRG).

Assessment steps (open-data approximation of professional practice):

1. HABU — existing authorised use (residential urban / agriculture rural).
   Hope value is excluded from the *basis of assessment* policy; market HPI is
   still existing-use transaction evidence (best open proxy).
2. Market value (MV) of a typical improved property at the location (council HPI).
3. Depreciated replacement cost (DRC) of improvements — rebuild £/m² × floor area
   × regional factor × remaining-value factor (Wightman residual strip).
4. Site capital (market residual) = max(0, MV − DRC), clamped to share bounds.
5. Economic site capital — Pickard adjustment so the roll charges economic rent,
   not speculative capital (farm productive factor; urban speculation discount).
6. Annual ground rent (roll base) = economic site capital × rentalisation yield.

Per-square map figures use £/sqm × grid area. Parcel and notional dwelling-plot
assessments are also reported when areas are known.
